To run the programs in this bundle, download and install Racket v6.9:

    http://www.racket-lang.org/

* Run the valid move checker by first being in the directory
  containing this file and then running:

     racket valid-move.rkt <filename>

  The script will print out the board that results from taking the
  move contained in the filename, or that it was an illegal move.

  The input file is expected to contain a color on the first line, and
  then be followed by the XML for a board, the XML for the dice (if
  the doubles bonus applies, then all four dice should be sent) and
  the XML for the desired moves.

  See the xml-tests/ for some example test cases you should consider
  using on your implementation. (You will need to implement the parser
  first before you can use them.)

  Use this script to test other examples where you're not sure or just
  to help out testing the server that you'll eventually be using your
  player with.

* To see a board, run this script:

    racket show-board.rkt -h

  The `-h` flag shows you the options the script supports.

* To run a tournament, run this script:

   racket tournament.rkt

  Passing a command line argument indicates what port to run the
  server on. Connect up to 20 players and, once their names appear in
  the list, click "start tournament" to start playing.
