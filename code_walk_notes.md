### Methods on spots
spot.has_blockade : bool
spot.next : _Spot
get_pawns : [Pawn]
get_safety : 
decorators for ensuring invariants?

crazy typed languages

document invariants:
- Pawns in a spot are same color
- Position values for special places

- Bake the negative ones in positions into a type
- We have a pair of numbers, rather than a union of numbers

- If we have "next" functions overridden in a series of spot classes, the next logic could do fun ~rules checking~
